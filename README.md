# SurveyGen: Quality-Aware Scientific Survey Generation with Large Language Models



This is the official repository for the dataset and code of the paper:  ["SurveyGen: Quality-Aware Scientific Survey Generation with Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17647),  *accepted at **EMNLP 2025** (Main Conference)*.


## üìÇ SurveyGen

Our dataset is constructed based on resources from [S2ORC](https://allenai.org/data/s2orc) (Lo et al., 2020) and [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) (Priem et al., 2022).  
The dataset can be accessed at:  [SurveyGen (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ky6FAd2rs9XPjmOrTMScPbPu_tBv4veh?usp=sharing)  

It contains three files:  

- **survey_full_text**: Parsed full texts of the surveys.  
- **references_for_surveys**: Metadata of the references directly cited in the surveys (named *first-level references*). 
- **second_level_references**: Metadata of the references cited by the first-level references.  



## üõ†Ô∏è Preparation Before Starting

Before using the SurveyGen framework, please ensure you have the following resources ready:

1. **Semantic Scholar API** ‚Äî Apply for an API key at [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key).  
2. **S2ORC metadata** ‚Äî Download the full S2ORC metadata to your local environment from [S2ORC](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/).
3. **LLM API access** ‚Äî Apply for access to the LLMs (e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://ai.google/discover/gemini/), or [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)).
